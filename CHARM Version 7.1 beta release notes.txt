5-31-2022: Notes on CHARM VERSION 7.1 beta.

           Some changes were made to support operation within the NASA RVLT
           toolchain.  This includes adding some output variables required
           in the .prt file and changing the logic for isolated rotor
           propulsive trim (ICOLL=3, 5 and 6) to trim to CT = constant
           for the rotor rather than lift (CTcos(shaft angle) = constant).

           A few minor bugs were also fixed - including the fact that
           p, q and r were previously applied about the aircraft frame
           origin instead of about the aircraft c.g. (only an issue if
           running with nonzero rotational rates) and a bug related to
           large tilt angle and attitude changes when tilt or attitude
           is used as a control option in full aircraft trim calculations.

4-1-2022:  Notes on CHARM VERSION 7.0 beta.

           New CHARM VERSION 7.0 beta software was placed in this folder
           on 4-1-2022 with some bug fixes from the previous version.
           The previous beta version had bugs when modeling a single wing 
           as two half wings without using the new NRTOO option described
           at the top of the Rotor/Wake Input File.

           A slightly updated manual was also placed in this folder today
           under the name CHARM VERSION 7.0a User's Manual.

           The 4-1-2022 CHARM VERSION 7.0 beta software has passed the
           full regression test with the exception of prop/wing
           calculations and CHARM/PSU-WOPWOP calculations.  These tests
           are ongoing as we transition to a new release of PSU-WOPWOP.
